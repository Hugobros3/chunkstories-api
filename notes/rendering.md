== Chunk Stories Graphics API ==

1) Declare a bunch of render buffers
2) Declare a bunch of shader passes (declare and inject dependencies) using those render buffers
	2.1) Include hooks in passes so they can bind custom uniforms and textures
	2.2) In the absence of geometry, a pass can be made a 'fs quad' pass, acting unifomrly accross the viewport
3) Declare how you want your content to be represented
	3.1) Voxels are either cubes or a custom Representation
		3.1.1) Voxel lightning will be done using corner light values bilinearly interpolated in the fragment shader
	3.2) Representations are the general way to deal with supplying the renderer
		3.2.1) Representations can be lights or models
		3.2.2) Representation include a position and a target pass
	3.3) Texture data is supplied as "Surfaces", containing albedo, normal and pbr maps
	3.4) Representations can be attached to an entity or hooked manually
4) Configure built-in systems
	4.1) Particles and decals can be made to be rendered in any pass you wish, in a per type fashion (and thus use your own shader variant)
	4.2) Heightmaps rendering also offers you such control
	4.3) You can decide to override the default deffered lightning pass
		4.3.1) In the future provisions should be made to enable forward or forward+ rendering techniques
5) Write your GUI against the providen framework

=== Shader Interfacing ===

 * Mesh vertice attributes are bound to the corresponding vertex shader input, if any
 * Instance data comes in interface blocks
 * Uniform data comes in interface blocks (only - no loose uniforms)
 * Interface blocks can have Java wrappers autogenerated

=== Implementation considerations ===

 * The implementations is expected to be API-independant : both OpenGL 3.3 and Vulkan are considered as targets
 * The bundling of the same models using instancing is expected to be a tremendous performance win, and the engine will be fully responsible of doing that
 * Skeletal matrices computations should be done hierachically when evaluating the representation. Morphed skeletal animation will be providen as instance data.
 * A GLSL->SPIR-V compiler will have to be included for the Vulkan backend
